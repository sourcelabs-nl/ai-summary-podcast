# Capability: Podcast Sources

## Purpose

CRUD operations for content sources scoped to podcasts, database-driven source polling (replacing YAML config), and source-scoped article deduplication.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Add source for a podcast
The system SHALL allow adding a content source scoped to a specific podcast. Each source record SHALL have: `id` (TEXT, primary key), `podcast_id` (TEXT, FK to podcasts), `type` (TEXT, one of: rss, website), `url` (TEXT), `poll_interval_minutes` (INTEGER, default 60), `enabled` (INTEGER, default 1), `last_polled` (TEXT, nullable), `last_seen_id` (TEXT, nullable).

#### Scenario: Add an RSS source to a podcast
- **WHEN** a `POST /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}/sources` request is received with `type: "rss"`, `url`, and optionally `pollIntervalMinutes` and `enabled`
- **THEN** the system creates a source record linked to the podcast and returns HTTP 201 with the created source

#### Scenario: Add source for non-existing podcast
- **WHEN** a `POST /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}/sources` request is received for a podcast that does not exist
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404

#### Scenario: Add source with missing required fields
- **WHEN** a `POST /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}/sources` request is received without `type` or `url`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 with a validation error message

### Requirement: List sources for a podcast
The system SHALL provide an endpoint to retrieve all sources belonging to a specific podcast.

#### Scenario: List podcast's sources
- **WHEN** a `GET /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}/sources` request is received for an existing podcast
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 200 with a JSON array of the podcast's sources

#### Scenario: List sources for non-existing podcast
- **WHEN** a `GET /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}/sources` request is received for a podcast that does not exist
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404

### Requirement: Update a podcast's source
The system SHALL allow updating a source's `url`, `type`, `pollIntervalMinutes`, and `enabled` fields.

#### Scenario: Update source configuration
- **WHEN** a `PUT /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}/sources/{sourceId}` request is received with updated fields
- **THEN** the system updates the source record and returns HTTP 200 with the updated source

#### Scenario: Update source belonging to a different podcast
- **WHEN** a `PUT /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}/sources/{sourceId}` request is received but the source belongs to a different podcast
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404

### Requirement: Delete a podcast's source
The system SHALL allow deleting a source, which MUST also delete all articles associated with that source.

#### Scenario: Delete existing source
- **WHEN** a `DELETE /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}/sources/{sourceId}` request is received for an existing source owned by the podcast
- **THEN** the system deletes the source and all its articles, and returns HTTP 204

#### Scenario: Delete non-existing source
- **WHEN** a `DELETE /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}/sources/{sourceId}` request is received for a source that does not exist or belongs to a different podcast
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404

### Requirement: Database-driven source polling replaces YAML config
The system SHALL poll sources from the database instead of from YAML configuration. The `SourceProperties` config class and `app.sources` YAML block SHALL be removed. The `SourcePollingScheduler` SHALL query all enabled sources from the database and poll each one based on its `poll_interval_minutes`.

#### Scenario: Poll sources from database
- **WHEN** the polling scheduler runs
- **THEN** it queries all sources from the database where `enabled = 1`, checks each source's `last_polled` against its `poll_interval_minutes`, and polls sources that are due

#### Scenario: No sources configured
- **WHEN** the polling scheduler runs and no sources exist in the database
- **THEN** it completes without polling anything

### Requirement: Article deduplication scoped to source
The `content_hash` uniqueness constraint SHALL be `UNIQUE(source_id, content_hash)` instead of globally unique. This allows the same article content to exist under different podcasts' sources while preventing duplicates within a single source.

#### Scenario: Same article from same source
- **WHEN** a source is polled and an article with the same `content_hash` already exists for that source
- **THEN** the article is skipped (not saved again)

#### Scenario: Same article from different podcasts' sources
- **WHEN** two podcasts subscribe to the same RSS feed and both sources are polled
- **THEN** the article is saved separately for each podcast's source (different `source_id`, same `content_hash`)
