# Capability: Article Dedup Filter

## Purpose

Topic-based deduplication filter that clusters candidate articles by topic, compares them against historical episode articles, and returns a filtered, annotated set for composition.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Topic dedup filter clusters and deduplicates articles before composition
The system SHALL provide a `TopicDedupFilter` component that clusters candidate articles by topic, compares them against historical episode articles, and returns a filtered, annotated set for composition. The filter SHALL use the filter model (cheap LLM) via a single call.

The filter SHALL receive:
- Candidate articles: list of articles with `id`, `title`, and `summary`
- Historical articles: list of articles from recent GENERATED episodes, with `episodeId`, `articleId`, `title`, and `summary`

The filter SHALL output a structured result with a `clusters` array. Each cluster SHALL contain:
- `topic`: short label describing the topic
- `status`: `NEW` (not covered in any recent episode) or `CONTINUATION` (covered before, with or without new developments)
- `previousContext`: (CONTINUATION only) one sentence describing what was covered before
- `candidateArticleIds`: all candidate article IDs in this cluster
- `selectedArticleIds`: article IDs to keep for composition (empty means skip the topic entirely)

#### Scenario: New topic with single article passes through
- **WHEN** a candidate article about "NVIDIA Blackwell GPU pricing" has no matching topic in historical articles
- **THEN** the filter creates a NEW cluster with that article in `selectedArticleIds`

#### Scenario: New topic with multiple articles selects top 3
- **WHEN** 5 candidate articles all cover "GPT-5 benchmark leaks" and no historical article covers this topic
- **THEN** the filter creates a NEW cluster with the 3 most comprehensive/complementary articles in `selectedArticleIds`

#### Scenario: New topic with 3 or fewer articles keeps all
- **WHEN** 2 candidate articles cover "Rust async runtime changes" with no historical match
- **THEN** the filter creates a NEW cluster with both articles in `selectedArticleIds`

#### Scenario: Continuation topic with new development keeps articles
- **WHEN** candidate articles cover "Gemini 2.5 pricing" and historical articles from a recent episode covered "Gemini 2.5 release and benchmarks"
- **THEN** the filter creates a CONTINUATION cluster with `previousContext` describing the prior coverage, and `selectedArticleIds` containing up to 3 articles with the new pricing information

#### Scenario: Continuation topic with no new development skips all
- **WHEN** candidate articles cover "Claude Code 1M context" and historical articles already covered the same announcement with the same facts
- **THEN** the filter creates a CONTINUATION cluster with `selectedArticleIds` empty

#### Scenario: Cross-source duplicates within today's batch merged into one cluster
- **WHEN** TechCrunch and The Verge both publish articles about the same Google announcement today
- **THEN** both articles appear in the same cluster, and the filter selects up to 3 with complementary coverage

#### Scenario: High-scoring single-source article not over-clustered
- **WHEN** a unique research paper about "formal verification of LLM agents" has no close match in other candidates or historical articles
- **THEN** the filter creates a single-article NEW cluster rather than merging it with loosely related topics

### Requirement: Dedup filter transforms output into annotated article blocks for composer
The system SHALL transform the dedup filter's cluster output into the composer's article input format. For CONTINUATION clusters with selected articles, the system SHALL prepend a `[FOLLOW-UP: ...]` header above the article group in the composer prompt, containing the `previousContext` from the cluster. For NEW clusters, articles SHALL appear without any header annotation.

#### Scenario: Continuation articles annotated with follow-up header
- **WHEN** a CONTINUATION cluster has `previousContext` = "Gemini 2.5 was released with benchmarks in a recent episode" and selected articles about pricing
- **THEN** the composer prompt includes `[FOLLOW-UP: Gemini 2.5 was released with benchmarks in a recent episode -- today's articles cover new pricing details]` above those articles

#### Scenario: New topic articles have no annotation
- **WHEN** a NEW cluster has 2 selected articles about a brand-new topic
- **THEN** the articles appear in the composer prompt without any `[FOLLOW-UP: ...]` header

### Requirement: Dedup filter fetches historical articles from recent episodes
The system SHALL fetch historical articles by joining `episode_articles` with `articles` for the most recent N GENERATED episodes (where N is the podcast's `recapLookbackEpisodes` or the global default). Only episodes with status `GENERATED` SHALL be included. The historical articles SHALL include `episodeId`, `articleId`, `title`, and `summary`.

#### Scenario: Historical articles fetched from last 7 generated episodes
- **WHEN** the dedup filter runs for a podcast with default lookback (7) and there are 10 GENERATED episodes
- **THEN** historical articles are fetched from the 7 most recent GENERATED episodes only

#### Scenario: Discarded and pending episodes excluded from history
- **WHEN** the most recent 3 episodes are DISCARDED and the 4th is GENERATED
- **THEN** historical articles are only fetched from GENERATED episodes, skipping the discarded ones
