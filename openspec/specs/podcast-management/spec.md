# Capability: Podcast Management

## Purpose

CRUD operations for podcasts scoped to users, where each podcast represents a distinct content feed with its own topic, sources, and episodes.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Podcast entity scoped to user
The system SHALL store podcasts in a `podcasts` database table with columns: `id` (TEXT, primary key, UUID), `user_id` (TEXT, FK to users, NOT NULL), `name` (TEXT, NOT NULL), `topic` (TEXT, NOT NULL), and `require_review` (INTEGER, NOT NULL, default 0). The `id` SHALL be generated as a UUID v4 upon creation. A user MAY have multiple podcasts, each with a different topic. The `require_review` field controls whether episode scripts require manual review before TTS generation. The `requireReview` field in the JSON request body SHALL be deserialized correctly for both `true` and `false` values when explicitly provided; Jackson 3 `@JsonProperty` annotations SHALL be used on nullable primitive DTO fields to ensure correct deserialization.

#### Scenario: Create a podcast
- **WHEN** a `POST /users/{userId}/podcasts` request is received with a JSON body containing `name` and `topic`
- **THEN** the system creates a podcast record linked to the user with a generated UUID and returns the created podcast with HTTP 201

#### Scenario: Create a podcast with review enabled
- **WHEN** a `POST /users/{userId}/podcasts` request is received with a JSON body containing `name`, `topic`, and `requireReview: true`
- **THEN** the system creates a podcast with `require_review` set to true and the response body SHALL contain `"requireReview": true`

#### Scenario: Update podcast to enable review
- **WHEN** a `PUT /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}` request is received with `requireReview: true`
- **THEN** the system updates the podcast's `require_review` to true and the response body SHALL contain `"requireReview": true`

#### Scenario: Create podcast for non-existing user
- **WHEN** a `POST /users/{userId}/podcasts` request is received for a user that does not exist
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404

#### Scenario: Create podcast with missing fields
- **WHEN** a `POST /users/{userId}/podcasts` request is received without `name` or `topic`
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 400 with a validation error message

### Requirement: List podcasts for a user
The system SHALL provide an endpoint to retrieve all podcasts belonging to a specific user.

#### Scenario: List user's podcasts
- **WHEN** a `GET /users/{userId}/podcasts` request is received for an existing user
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 200 with a JSON array of the user's podcasts (id, name, topic)

#### Scenario: List podcasts for non-existing user
- **WHEN** a `GET /users/{userId}/podcasts` request is received for a user that does not exist
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404

#### Scenario: List podcasts when user has none
- **WHEN** a `GET /users/{userId}/podcasts` request is received for a user with no podcasts
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 200 with an empty JSON array

### Requirement: Get single podcast
The system SHALL provide an endpoint to retrieve a specific podcast by ID, scoped to the owning user.

#### Scenario: Get existing podcast
- **WHEN** a `GET /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}` request is received for an existing podcast owned by the user
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 200 with the podcast's details (id, name, topic)

#### Scenario: Get non-existing podcast
- **WHEN** a `GET /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}` request is received for a podcast that does not exist or belongs to a different user
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404

### Requirement: Update podcast
The system SHALL allow updating a podcast's `name`, `topic`, and `requireReview` fields.

#### Scenario: Update podcast name and topic
- **WHEN** a `PUT /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}` request is received with a JSON body containing `name` and/or `topic`
- **THEN** the system updates the podcast record and returns HTTP 200 with the updated podcast

#### Scenario: Enable review on existing podcast
- **WHEN** a `PUT /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}` request is received with `requireReview: true`
- **THEN** the system updates the podcast's `require_review` to true; subsequent briefing generations will create pending episodes instead of auto-generating audio

#### Scenario: Update non-existing podcast
- **WHEN** a `PUT /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}` request is received for a podcast that does not exist or belongs to a different user
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404

### Requirement: Delete podcast with cascade
The system SHALL allow deleting a podcast, which MUST cascade-delete all of the podcast's sources, associated articles, episodes, and audio files on disk.

#### Scenario: Delete existing podcast
- **WHEN** a `DELETE /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}` request is received for an existing podcast owned by the user
- **THEN** the system deletes the podcast, all its sources, all articles belonging to those sources, all its episodes, removes associated audio files from disk, and returns HTTP 204

#### Scenario: Delete non-existing podcast
- **WHEN** a `DELETE /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}` request is received for a podcast that does not exist or belongs to a different user
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 404
