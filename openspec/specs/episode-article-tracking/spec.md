# Capability: Episode-Article Tracking

## Purpose

Tracks which articles contributed to each episode, providing traceability from episodes back to their source articles.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Episode-article join table
The system SHALL maintain an `episode_articles` join table with columns: `id` (auto-generated INTEGER PRIMARY KEY), `episode_id` (INTEGER, NOT NULL, FK to episodes), `article_id` (INTEGER, NOT NULL, FK to articles). A unique constraint SHALL exist on `(episode_id, article_id)` to prevent duplicate linkage. This table enables traceability from episodes back to the articles that contributed to them.

Episode-article links SHALL be saved for ALL episode generation paths, including both the scheduled generation (`BriefingGenerationScheduler`) and manual generation (`PodcastController.generate()`). Both paths SHALL delegate to shared logic in `EpisodeService` to save episode-article links.

#### Scenario: Articles linked to episode after briefing generation
- **WHEN** a briefing is composed from 5 relevant articles and an episode is created
- **THEN** 5 rows are created in `episode_articles`, each linking one article to the episode

#### Scenario: Articles linked to episode after manual generation
- **WHEN** a manual generation via `POST /users/{userId}/podcasts/{podcastId}/generate` produces an episode from 3 articles
- **THEN** 3 rows are created in `episode_articles`, each linking one article to the episode

#### Scenario: Duplicate linkage prevented
- **WHEN** an `(episode_id, article_id)` combination already exists in `episode_articles`
- **THEN** the duplicate insert is rejected

#### Scenario: Episode with no articles
- **WHEN** an episode is created but the pipeline returned no articles (edge case)
- **THEN** no rows are created in `episode_articles`

### Requirement: Episode-article repository
The system SHALL provide a Spring Data JDBC repository for the `EpisodeArticle` entity with methods to save links and query articles by episode.

#### Scenario: Save episode-article links in bulk
- **WHEN** an episode is created from 3 articles
- **THEN** the repository saves 3 `EpisodeArticle` records

#### Scenario: Find articles for an episode
- **WHEN** querying articles for episode ID 42
- **THEN** the repository returns all article IDs linked to episode 42

### Requirement: Pipeline returns processed article IDs
The `LlmPipeline` SHALL return the list of processed article IDs in `PipelineResult` so that callers can record episode-article links after the episode is persisted.

#### Scenario: PipelineResult includes article IDs
- **WHEN** the LLM pipeline processes 5 articles into a briefing
- **THEN** the `PipelineResult` contains the IDs of all 5 processed articles

#### Scenario: PipelineResult with no articles
- **WHEN** the LLM pipeline finds no relevant articles and returns null
- **THEN** no `PipelineResult` is returned (null)

### Requirement: Shared episode creation logic in EpisodeService
The system SHALL provide a method in `EpisodeService` that encapsulates the post-pipeline episode creation logic: saving the episode, saving episode-article links, generating a recap, and updating `lastGeneratedAt` on the podcast. Both `BriefingGenerationScheduler` and `PodcastController.generate()` SHALL delegate to this shared method instead of reimplementing the logic independently.

The system SHALL NOT advance `lastGeneratedAt` when the pipeline returns no results (null). Only the successful creation of an episode SHALL update this timestamp. This ensures that articles published before the timestamp remain visible in the upcoming view even when a pipeline run finds no relevant content to compose.

#### Scenario: Scheduler delegates to shared creation logic
- **WHEN** `BriefingGenerationScheduler` completes a pipeline run with a non-null result
- **THEN** it calls the shared `EpisodeService` method which saves the episode, links articles, generates recap, and updates `lastGeneratedAt`

#### Scenario: Manual generate delegates to shared creation logic
- **WHEN** `PodcastController.generate()` completes a pipeline run with a non-null result
- **THEN** it calls the same shared `EpisodeService` method which saves the episode, links articles, generates recap, and updates `lastGeneratedAt`

#### Scenario: Episode recap generated for manually triggered episodes
- **WHEN** a manual generation produces an episode
- **THEN** a recap is generated and stored on the episode, matching the behavior of scheduled generation

#### Scenario: Pipeline returns no results
- **WHEN** `llmPipeline.run()` returns null (no relevant articles to compose)
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT update `lastGeneratedAt` on the podcast

#### Scenario: Pipeline returns results and episode is created
- **WHEN** `llmPipeline.run()` returns a `PipelineResult` and an episode is successfully created
- **THEN** `lastGeneratedAt` SHALL be updated to the current timestamp
