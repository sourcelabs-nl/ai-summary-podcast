## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: User picker
The system SHALL display a user picker dropdown in the header that fetches all users from `GET /users` and allows selecting one. The selected user context SHALL be used for all subsequent API calls. The dropdown popover SHALL align to the end (right) of the trigger. A gear icon button (Settings icon from lucide-react) SHALL be displayed to the right of the user dropdown, navigating to `/settings`. The icon button SHALL use the `ghost` variant with `text-primary-foreground` styling and SHALL have a `border border-input rounded-md h-9` style matching the user dropdown trigger's border appearance.

#### Scenario: User selection persists across navigation
- **WHEN** user selects a user from the picker and navigates between pages
- **THEN** the selected user remains active and all API calls use that user's ID

#### Scenario: No users available
- **WHEN** the user picker fetches from `GET /users` and receives an empty list
- **THEN** the picker SHALL display a message indicating no users are available

#### Scenario: Settings icon navigates to preferences
- **WHEN** the user clicks the gear icon button next to the user dropdown
- **THEN** the app navigates to `/settings`

#### Scenario: Settings icon hidden when no user selected
- **WHEN** no user is selected (loading or no users available)
- **THEN** the gear icon button SHALL NOT be displayed
