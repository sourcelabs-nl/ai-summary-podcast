## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Post persistence with deduplication
The system SHALL persist individual content items in a `posts` SQLite table with columns: `id` (auto-generated INTEGER PRIMARY KEY), `source_id` (TEXT, NOT NULL, FK to sources), `title` (TEXT, NOT NULL), `body` (TEXT, NOT NULL), `url` (TEXT, NOT NULL), `published_at` (TEXT, nullable), `author` (TEXT, nullable), `content_hash` (TEXT, NOT NULL), `created_at` (TEXT, NOT NULL, ISO-8601 timestamp of when the post was stored). Deduplication SHALL be enforced via a unique constraint on `(source_id, content_hash)`. An index SHALL exist on `(source_id, created_at)` for efficient time-windowed queries.

#### Scenario: New post stored successfully
- **WHEN** a post with a unique content hash for its source is saved
- **THEN** the post is persisted with all fields populated and `created_at` set to the current timestamp

#### Scenario: Duplicate post rejected
- **WHEN** a post with an already-existing `(source_id, content_hash)` combination is saved
- **THEN** the duplicate is silently ignored and the existing record remains unchanged

#### Scenario: Posts from different sources with same content hash
- **WHEN** two posts from different sources have the same content hash
- **THEN** both posts are stored (deduplication is scoped per source)

### Requirement: Post-article join table
The system SHALL maintain a `post_articles` join table with columns: `id` (auto-generated INTEGER PRIMARY KEY), `post_id` (INTEGER, NOT NULL, FK to posts), `article_id` (INTEGER, NOT NULL, FK to articles). A unique constraint SHALL exist on `(post_id, article_id)` to prevent duplicate linkage. This table enables traceability from articles back to their source posts and supports reprocessing by allowing the same post to be linked to multiple articles.

#### Scenario: Posts linked to article during aggregation
- **WHEN** 5 posts are aggregated into a single article
- **THEN** 5 rows are created in `post_articles`, each linking one post to the article

#### Scenario: Non-aggregated post linked to article
- **WHEN** a single post from a non-aggregated source is converted to an article
- **THEN** 1 row is created in `post_articles` linking the post to its article

#### Scenario: Same post linked to multiple articles
- **WHEN** a post is reprocessed and included in a new article
- **THEN** a second `post_articles` row is created linking the post to the new article, while the original link remains

#### Scenario: Duplicate linkage prevented
- **WHEN** a `(post_id, article_id)` combination already exists in `post_articles`
- **THEN** the duplicate insert is rejected

### Requirement: Unlinked post queries
The system SHALL provide a repository method to find posts that have no entry in `post_articles` for a given set of source IDs and within a time window. This query supports finding posts that have not yet been aggregated into any article.

#### Scenario: Find unlinked posts within time window
- **WHEN** querying for unlinked posts for source "src-1" within the last 7 days
- **THEN** only posts from source "src-1" created within the last 7 days that have no entry in `post_articles` are returned

#### Scenario: Previously linked posts excluded
- **WHEN** a post has been linked to an article via `post_articles`
- **THEN** that post is NOT returned by the unlinked posts query

#### Scenario: Posts outside time window excluded
- **WHEN** querying with a 7-day time window and a post was created 10 days ago
- **THEN** that post is NOT returned even if it has no `post_articles` entry

### Requirement: Old unprocessed post cleanup
The system SHALL periodically delete posts that are older than the configured maximum article age (`app.source.max-article-age-days`) AND have no entry in `post_articles`. Posts that have been linked to at least one article SHALL NOT be deleted regardless of age.

#### Scenario: Old unlinked posts deleted
- **WHEN** cleanup runs and posts exist with `created_at` older than `max-article-age-days` that have no `post_articles` entries
- **THEN** those posts are deleted

#### Scenario: Old linked posts retained
- **WHEN** cleanup runs and posts exist with `created_at` older than `max-article-age-days` that have `post_articles` entries
- **THEN** those posts are NOT deleted (they are historical records linked to articles)

#### Scenario: Recent unlinked posts retained
- **WHEN** cleanup runs and posts exist with `created_at` within `max-article-age-days` that have no `post_articles` entries
- **THEN** those posts are NOT deleted (they may be aggregated in a future pipeline run)
