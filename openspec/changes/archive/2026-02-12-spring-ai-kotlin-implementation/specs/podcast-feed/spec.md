## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: RSS 2.0 podcast feed generation
The system SHALL generate a valid RSS 2.0 XML file using ROME's `SyndFeed` API. The feed SHALL include standard podcast metadata (title, description, link) from application configuration, and each episode SHALL be represented as an `<item>` with an `<enclosure>` tag pointing to the MP3 file URL. The feed SHALL be regenerated each time a new episode is produced.

#### Scenario: Feed generated with episodes
- **WHEN** 3 episodes exist in the database
- **THEN** the RSS feed contains 3 `<item>` entries, each with a valid `<enclosure>` tag containing the MP3 URL, file size in bytes, and MIME type `audio/mpeg`

#### Scenario: Feed generated with no episodes
- **WHEN** no episodes exist in the database
- **THEN** the RSS feed is valid XML with channel metadata but no `<item>` entries

#### Scenario: Feed updated after new episode
- **WHEN** a new episode is generated by the TTS pipeline
- **THEN** the RSS feed XML is regenerated to include the new episode

### Requirement: MP3 file serving
The system SHALL serve MP3 files over HTTP from the configured episodes directory using Spring Boot's static resource handling. Files SHALL be accessible at a URL path that matches the `<enclosure>` URLs in the RSS feed.

#### Scenario: MP3 file accessible via HTTP
- **WHEN** a podcast app requests an MP3 URL from the feed
- **THEN** the MP3 file is served with content type `audio/mpeg`

#### Scenario: Missing MP3 returns 404
- **WHEN** a request is made for a non-existent MP3 file
- **THEN** the server returns HTTP 404

### Requirement: RSS feed serving
The system SHALL serve the podcast RSS feed XML over HTTP at a well-known endpoint (e.g., `/feed.xml`). Podcast apps subscribe to this URL.

#### Scenario: Feed accessible via HTTP
- **WHEN** a podcast app requests `/feed.xml`
- **THEN** the RSS XML is served with content type `application/rss+xml`

### Requirement: Episode cleanup
The system SHALL run a scheduled cleanup job that deletes episodes older than the configured retention period (default: 30 days). Cleanup SHALL remove both the database record and the MP3 file from disk. The podcast feed SHALL be regenerated after cleanup.

#### Scenario: Old episodes cleaned up
- **WHEN** the cleanup job runs and 2 episodes are older than 30 days
- **THEN** both episode records are deleted from the database, their MP3 files are deleted from disk, and the RSS feed is regenerated

#### Scenario: Recent episodes preserved
- **WHEN** the cleanup job runs and all episodes are less than 30 days old
- **THEN** no episodes are deleted

#### Scenario: Cleanup with missing MP3 file
- **WHEN** an episode record references an MP3 file that no longer exists on disk
- **THEN** the episode database record is still deleted and a warning is logged
