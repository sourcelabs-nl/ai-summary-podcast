## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: RSS 2.0 podcast feed generation
The system SHALL generate a valid RSS 2.0 XML file using ROME's `SyndFeed` API. The feed SHALL include standard podcast metadata (title, description, link) from application configuration, and each episode SHALL be represented as an `<item>` with an `<enclosure>` tag pointing to the MP3 file URL. The feed SHALL be regenerated each time a new episode is produced. The feed SHALL include a `<language>` element set to the podcast's configured language code.

#### Scenario: Feed generated with episodes
- **WHEN** 3 episodes exist in the database
- **THEN** the RSS feed contains 3 `<item>` entries, each with a valid `<enclosure>` tag containing the MP3 URL, file size in bytes, and MIME type `audio/mpeg`

#### Scenario: Feed generated with no episodes
- **WHEN** no episodes exist in the database
- **THEN** the RSS feed is valid XML with channel metadata but no `<item>` entries

#### Scenario: Feed updated after new episode
- **WHEN** a new episode is generated by the TTS pipeline
- **THEN** the RSS feed XML is regenerated to include the new episode

#### Scenario: Feed includes language element
- **WHEN** the RSS feed is generated for a podcast with language `"nl"`
- **THEN** the RSS XML contains `<language>nl</language>` in the channel element

#### Scenario: Feed language defaults to English
- **WHEN** the RSS feed is generated for a podcast with default language `"en"`
- **THEN** the RSS XML contains `<language>en</language>` in the channel element
